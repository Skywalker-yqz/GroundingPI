"""WAM policy facade: one obs→action entry point over the two executors.

``WAMPolicy`` is the seam between the server (which hands it preprocessed
observations) and the execution mechanism (which schedules engine calls):

- sync mode (default): :class:`SyncInferenceExecutor` — blocking
  buffer-and-replan with a bounded execution horizon.
- async mode: :class:`AsyncInferenceExecutor` — double-buffered background
  inference overlapping generation with execution.

The executor is chosen once at construction from the normalized async
config; per-step dispatch is plain delegation.
